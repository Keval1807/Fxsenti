EXAMPLES OF GOOD VS BAD ANALYSIS:

BAD (Generic): 
"pros": ["Dollar strength", "Good economic data", "Market sentiment positive"]

GOOD (Specific):
"pros": [
    "Fed hawkish pivot raises 2024 rate expectations to 4.75%, widening USD yield advantage over EUR by 150bps",
    "Stronger-than-expected retail sales (+0.6% vs +0.3% est) reduces recession fears and supports USD",
    "Technical breakout above 104.50 DXY resistance confirms bullish momentum, targeting 106.00"
]

BAD (Vague):
"entry": "Buy on dips"

GOOD (Actionable):
"entry": "Enter long EUR/USD at 1.0850 if price pulls back to test broken resistance-turned-support, or on break above 1.0920 with 15-min candle close confirmation"

REMEMBER:
- You're being evaluated on USEFULNESS to real traders
- Vague advice is WORSE than saying "not enough information"
- SPECIFIC numbers and levels are CRITICAL
- Explain your reasoning - traders need to understand WHY
- Consider BOTH sides - pros AND cons for each currency
- Think about TIMING - when should traders act?
- Address RISK - what could go wrong?

If the news article doesn't provide enough information for specific analysis, SAY SO and explain what additional data you'd need. Don't make up specific price levels if you don't have current market data.
